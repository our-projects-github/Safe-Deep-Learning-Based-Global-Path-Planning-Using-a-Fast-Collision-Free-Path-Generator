### Explanation

 This repository share the implementation of "Safe Deep Learning-Based Global Path Planning Using a Fast Collision-Free Path Generator". in this project we present a safe deep learning based path planning method 


  
# Instructions
   

### ‚öô Usage Steps
1. clone the repository in your google drive. 
2. use the main or main_test a sample notebooks. 
3. In the second cell of the notebooks, you can change the root directory for accessing AI2THOR_py folder.

---       
    
### üìÑ main 

<strong>Use it for doing all the project from the scratch.</strong>
<br> 
At first, it gets the number of your desired environment between 194 different AI2THOR environments. Then it creates a map containing polygonal obstacles

---

### üìÑ main_test a smple  

<strong>Use it for simulating a sample path in AI2THOR environment.</strong>
<br> 
this notebook runs the simulation of AI2THOR on a path that you can create using a pre-trained model. the output of this noteboke contains 3 videos of the robot movement from different point of views.

### üìÅ AI2THOR_py    
    
- <strong> ai2thormap: </strong> creates map contains obstacle polygons for AI2THOR environments
    
    
- <strong> ai2thorgeneratepatches: </strong> contain a function that displays polygons of the considered environment in AI2THOR.
    

- <strong> ai2thorgeneratesamlpes: </strong> contain functions that generates sample points from free-space in the environment.
    
    
- <strong> ai2thorcreatedata: </strong> contain functions that creates any amount of path data that is needed using GB method for the desired environment.
    
    
- <strong> ai2thorprocessdata: </strong> contains functions that selects the required input and output of the LSTM network using the path create by the GB method.
        
    
- <strong> ai2thorloss: </strong> tensorflow implementation of the MSE-NER and keras implementation of the MSE loss functions.
    
    
- <strong> ai2thormodel: </strong> implementation of the LSTM network (OracleNet) used for path planning.
    
    
- <strong> ai2thortrain: </strong> contains functions that train the LSTM network using the processed data created by GB method and save the model.
    
    
- <strong> ai2thortest: </strong> contains functions that evaluate the trained model for the desired as well as random start and goal points.
    

- <strong> AI2THOR_PATH2GIF: </strong> Simulates the Robot movement in an AI2THOR environment.
