### Explanation

This repository share the implementation of "Safe Deep Learning-Based Global Path Planning Using a Fast Collision-Free Path Generator". in this project we present a safe deep learning based global path planning method. this method is based on an LSTM model which predicts paths for desired start and goal points in an enviroment containing polygonal obstacles. for obtaining safe paths which have appropriate distance from obstacles we developed a new loss function that is implemented in this project. you can use both "main" and "main_test a sample" notebooks for your experiments to do the project from scratch or use the pre-traind models. the Results of this project led to publishing 2 papers which you can access from the above links.  


  
# Instructions
   

### ‚öô Usage Steps
1. clone the repository in your google drive. 
2. use the main or main_test a sample notebooks. 
3. In the second cell of the notebooks, you can change the root directory for accessing AI2THOR_py folder.

---       
    
### üìÑ main 

<strong>Use it for doing all the project from the scratch.</strong>
<br> 
At first, it gets the number of your desired environment between 194 different AI2THOR environments. Then it creates a map containing polygonal obstacles

---

### üìÑ main_test a smple  

<strong>Use it for simulating a sample path in AI2THOR environment.</strong>
<br> 
this notebook runs the simulation of AI2THOR on a path that you can create using a pre-trained model. the output of this noteboke contains 3 videos of the robot movement from different point of views.
