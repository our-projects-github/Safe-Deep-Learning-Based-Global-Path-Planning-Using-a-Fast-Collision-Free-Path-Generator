### üí¨ Explanation
The implementation of "Safe Deep Learning-Based Global Path Planning Using a Fast Collision-Free Path Generator" is shared in this repository. We present a safe deep learning-based global path planning method in this project. This method is based on an LSTM model that predicts paths for the desired start and goal points in an environment with polygonal obstacles. To predict safe paths with an appropriate distance from obstacles, a new loss function (MSE-NER) is developed. You can conduct experiments in both the "main" and "main test a sample" notebooks to build the project from scratch or to use pre-trained models. The AI2THOR framework is used for the simulations, and you can test our path planning method on all of its environments. The results of this project resulted in the publication of two papers, which you can access via the links above. Additionally, in the Gallery section, you can see the robot movement for a sample path generated using our method in an AI2THOR environment.



  
# Instructions
   

### ‚öô Usage Steps
1. clone the repository in your google drive. 
2. use the "main" or "main_test a sample" notebooks. 
3. In the second cell of the notebooks, you can change the root directory for accessing AI2THOR_py folder.

### üìÑ main 

<strong>Use it for doing all the project from the scratch.</strong>
<br> 
At first, it asks you for the number of your desired environment between 194 different AI2THOR environments. Then it creates a map containing polygonal obstacles and generates as many as path data that is needed for training the LSTM model. After that, you can train the model and see how it performs in the environment for¬†some random starts and goals. Finally, it provides three mp4 files in which you can see the robot's movements between a start point and a goal point in the AI2THOR framework's selected environment from various points of view.

### üìÑ main_test a smple  

<strong>Use it for simulating a sample path in AI2THOR environment.</strong><br>
This notebook includes just final steps of the "main" notebook and enables you to simulate the robot movements. You can generate a sample path for the robot using a pre-trained model. The notebook's output contains three videos of the robot's movement from various points of view.
